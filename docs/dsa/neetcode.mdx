# NeetCode Problems

NeetCode is a popular resource for practicing coding problems. It offers a variety of problems that help in preparing for technical interviews. Below are some categories of problems you can find on NeetCode:

## Array

- **Two Sum**: Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
- **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock**: Find the maximum profit you can achieve from buying and selling a stock.

## Linked List

- **Reverse Linked List**: Reverse a singly linked list.
- **Merge Two Sorted Lists**: Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new sorted list.

## Dynamic Programming

- **Climbing Stairs**: You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
- **Longest Increasing Subsequence**: Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array of integers.

## Tree

- **Maximum Depth of Binary Tree**: Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
- **Validate Binary Search Tree**: Determine if a given binary tree is a valid binary search tree.

## Graph

- **Number of Islands**: Given a 2D grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands.
- **Clone Graph**: Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.

## Backtracking

- **Permutations**: Given a collection of distinct integers, return all possible permutations.
- **Combination Sum**: Given a set of candidate numbers and a target number, find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sum to the target.

These problems are just a few examples from NeetCode. Practicing these problems will help you improve your problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews.
