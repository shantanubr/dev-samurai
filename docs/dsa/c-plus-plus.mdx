# Introduction to C++

C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

## Key Features of C++

- **Object-Oriented**: C++ supports the object-oriented programming paradigm, which includes concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **Performance**: C++ is known for its high performance and is often used in applications where performance is critical, such as game development, real-time systems, and high-frequency trading.
- **Standard Library**: C++ has a rich standard library that provides many functions for tasks such as input/output, string manipulation, data structures, and algorithms.
- **Portability**: C++ code can be compiled on many different platforms, making it a portable language.
