# Introduction to Data Structures

Data structures are a fundamental concept in computer science and programming. They are used to store and organize data in a way that enables efficient access and modification. Understanding data structures is crucial for writing efficient and optimized code.

## Types of Data Structures

1. **Arrays**: A collection of elements identified by index or key.
2. **Linked Lists**: A linear collection of elements, where each element points to the next.
3. **Stacks**: A collection of elements that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
4. **Queues**: A collection of elements that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
5. **Trees**: A hierarchical structure with nodes, where each node has a value and children nodes.
6. **Graphs**: A collection of nodes connected by edges, used to represent networks.
7. **Hash Tables**: A structure that maps keys to values for efficient lookup.

## Importance of Data Structures

- **Efficiency**: Proper use of data structures can greatly improve the efficiency of algorithms.
- **Organization**: They help in organizing data in a way that makes it easier to process and retrieve.
- **Optimization**: Choosing the right data structure can optimize the performance of your code.
