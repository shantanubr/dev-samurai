# Introduction to Computer Networking

Computer networking is the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources and information. Networks can be as small as two computers connected together or as large as the internet, which connects millions of computers worldwide.

## Types of Networks

1. **Local Area Network (LAN)**: A network that is confined to a small geographic area, such as a single building or a campus.
2. **Wide Area Network (WAN)**: A network that spans a large geographic area, such as a city, country, or even the globe.
3. **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**: A network that covers a larger geographic area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, typically a city or a large campus.
4. **Personal Area Network (PAN)**: A network that is used for communication among devices close to one person, such as a computer, smartphone, and tablet.

## Network Topologies

1. **Bus Topology**: All devices are connected to a single central cable, called the bus or backbone.
2. **Star Topology**: All devices are connected to a central hub or switch.
3. **Ring Topology**: All devices are connected in a circular fashion, with each device having exactly two neighbors.
4. **Mesh Topology**: Devices are interconnected, with each device connected to multiple other devices.

## Network Protocols

1. **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)**: The fundamental protocol suite for the internet.
2. **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**: The protocol used for transmitting web pages over the internet.
3. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: A protocol used for transferring files between computers.
4. **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: A protocol used for sending email.
