# Introduction to CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

## Why Use CSS?

- **Separation of Content and Presentation**: CSS allows you to separate the content of your HTML from the design and layout, making it easier to maintain and update your website.
- **Reusability**: You can use the same CSS file across multiple pages, ensuring a consistent look and feel throughout your site.
- **Improved Load Times**: By using CSS, you can reduce the amount of code in your HTML files, which can help improve load times.
