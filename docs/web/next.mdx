# Introduction to Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that enables several extra features, including server-side rendering and generating static websites. It is built on top of Node.js and can be used to create web applications with React.

## Key Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Next.js allows you to render your React components on the server side, which can improve performance and SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** You can generate static HTML pages at build time, which can be served with minimal server resources.
- **API Routes:** Next.js provides a way to create API endpoints within your application, making it easy to handle backend logic.
- **File-based Routing:** Pages in Next.js are defined by the file structure in the `pages` directory, simplifying the routing setup.
- **CSS and Sass Support:** Next.js has built-in support for CSS and Sass, allowing you to style your components easily.
