# Introduction to the Internet and the World Wide Web

## What is the Internet?

The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate with each other using standardized protocols. It allows for the exchange of data and information across vast distances, enabling a wide range of activities such as browsing websites, sending emails, and streaming videos.

## What is the World Wide Web (WWW)?

The World Wide Web, commonly known as the Web, is a system of interlinked hypertext documents and multimedia content that is accessed via the Internet. It was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 and has since become one of the most important tools for communication, information sharing, and commerce.

## Key Components of the Web

1. **Web Browsers**: Software applications used to access and navigate the Web. Examples include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari.
2. **Web Servers**: Computers that store and serve web content to users. They respond to requests from web browsers and deliver the requested resources.
3. **URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)**: Addresses used to locate resources on the Web. A typical URL looks like `https://www.example.com`.
4. **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)**: The standard language used to create and format web pages. It allows for the inclusion of text, images, links, and other multimedia elements.

## How the Web Works

When you enter a URL into your web browser, the following steps occur:

1. The browser sends a request to the web server hosting the requested resource.
2. The web server processes the request and sends back the appropriate HTML content.
3. The browser interprets the HTML and displays the web page to the user.
